## Date BP (>0 is BP !!) to force the insolation, ice-sheets and GHGs
34000   palaeo_year

## irunlabel that corresponds to that year
## could be the begining of the simulation or a previous coherent time
8000 ref_irunlabel

## Acceleration factor: 1 = realtime, >1 is accelerated for slow B.C.
## Beware that the acceleration factor should not change between the ref_irunlabel and the point where you are in the simulation
## In case you want to change it from your restarting file, use the first year of the next simulations as a reference point
1 accel_rt

## Transient or equilibrium: will each new computed year be a new B.C. year or should the B.C. be fixed
## 0 is transient, 1 is equilibrium
1 equil_flag
